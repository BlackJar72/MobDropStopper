**This is a simple plugin which can remove or replace items dropped by mobs.** It was originally created for use with Cauldron servers and mods that replace vanilla items with modded ones (on some versions of Cauldron this will result in both the modded and vanilla drop rather than a replacement - for example cows dropping both raw hides and leather when only hides are intended). However, this could be used on other types of servers to removal of a certain mob drop is desired. Due to a bug it does not work on flying mobs.

***This plugin is dead* and will there will be no further development,** because frankly I don't like Bukkit - it seems to be the thing everyone used because there wasn't anything better for server-side-only plugins at the time, and then kept using because of the time / effort / code already invested (i.e., to avoid starting over). However, so far I'm just not impressed, it seems clunky, buggy, limiting, and even non-deterministic. Add that the spiteful GPL fanatic (who could have simply offered a less restrictive license) has already killed it as far ad further development is concerned ... no point in boarding a sinking shift. I'll be going back to forge and to working on my own games instead. Sorry, I just don't feel like putting time into Bukkit stuff in the forseeable future.

(Note, there may already be an improved version in GitHub, if someone can compiling into a properly working artifact.)
