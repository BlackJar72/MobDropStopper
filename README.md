This is a simple plugin which can remove or replace items dropped by mobs.  It was originally created for use with Cauldron servers and mods that replace vanilla items with modded ones (on some versions of Cauldron this will result in both the modded and vanilla drop rather than a replacement - for example cows dropping both raw hides and leather when only hides are intended).  However, this could be used on other types of servers to removal of a certain mob drop is desired.  Any number of items may be removed or dropped based on the config - don't want gunpower on your server?  You can prevent it from ever dropping.  Want to take out ghast tears from UHC?  Done!  Or replace them with gold nuggests!

Unlike some plugins that work by mob, this works by the drop.  List the items you don't want dropped, or the remove/replace pairs, and it will be applied to all such drops - so, to replace spider eyes with, say fermented spider eyes, one listing does for all spider types, and string is unaffected.
